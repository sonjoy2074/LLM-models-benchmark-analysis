 1. Find the Height of a Binary Tree                                                                                                                         
 Write a function to find the height of a binary tree. The height of a binary tree is the number of                                                          
 edges in the longest path from the root to a leaf node. For an empty tree, the height is -1.

 Write a function to check if two binary trees are identical. Two binary trees are identical if they                                                         
 have the same structure and their corresponding nodes have the same values.

 Given a binary tree and two nodes, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes.                                                                  
 The LCA of two nodes is the deepest node that is an ancestor of both nodes.
